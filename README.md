# Cryptocurrencies

### note: 
Despite installing plotly and hvplot in my terminal at the beginning of the module, and it having worked when doing the module work a month ago, I continued to receive the message saying unable to find these modules when I began to work on this challenges. I addressed this issue by pip installing the modules in the jupyter notebook.   

## Project objectives: 

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. To do this, theyâ€™ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

to do this, I will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, the best method is a clustering algorithm. The data created will be used for her to display the results. 

## Method: 

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
